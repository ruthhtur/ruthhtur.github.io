    <h1>Redesigning Atlassian Developer Documentation <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Remodeling&nbsp;<span class="caps">IA</span></h1>

<p>Our previous redesign of our developer documentation site  had technically lived up to its&nbsp;aspirations: 
It was on brand, and had a new&nbsp;layout. 
But, our brand guidelines quickly changed. Our typography guidelines, logos, and even illustration&nbsp;style 
changed in a short period, and our site looked&nbsp;dated. </p>

<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the only problem. Users we showed the site to complained that it looked like &ldquo;any&rdquo; site,&nbsp;but 
that it had a lot of jargon. When we asked them what the difference between &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; and &lsquo;server&rsquo; were,&nbsp;we 
got blank stares. We reskinned something, but the utility for users wasn&rsquo;t improved at&nbsp;all. </p>

<p>We learned many things from the first&nbsp;redesign: </p>

<ul>
<li>Set clear metrics from the outset of the project<br></li>
<li>Look at data <em>first</em>, before we start sketching ideas<br></li>
<li>Pair a data dive with qualitative research: What do people think of our current&nbsp;design?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looked like&nbsp;before: </p>

<p><img alt="implemented" src="../../images/implemented-930f79c2.png" /></p>

<h3>What we did&nbsp;differently</h3>

<p>We divided our goals into three&nbsp;parts: </p>

<ol>
<li>Where are people <strong>already</strong> going on our site? (and, how can we help them get there?)<br></li>
<li>What are people <strong>searching for</strong> on our site? (and, how can we optimize for their terms?)<br></li>
<li>What do we <strong>want</strong> to show people on our site? (and, where does it belong with all these other goals?)<br></li>
</ol>

<p>For the first goal, we took a deep dive into Google Analytics. We looked at page hits, and divided them&nbsp;up 
by product. We realized we&rsquo;d made a crucial mistake in the first redesign: People didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;conceptualize 
their development needs by SaaS or behind-the-firewall platform, they just thought about the <em>product</em>&nbsp;they 
were developing for. We talked to customers at Summit, and found that people didn&rsquo;t care much&nbsp;about 
(or even know about) the deployment model, just the product they were working on. We saw data trends&nbsp;that 
clustered around certain products: High hits on <span class="caps">JIRA</span>, with Confluence coming in second. Everything else&nbsp;was 
basically small potatoes, and nobody was really going to sections &ldquo;about&rdquo; SaaS or server&nbsp;deployment. </p>

<p>Then, we looked at what people were searching for. The documentation was well-indexed by Google,&nbsp;and 
reaffirmed our insight about the product-centric need for content (not platform-centric). We also saw&nbsp;that 
people were searching mostly on Google, and that was their entry point. So, we needed to create&nbsp;an 
intuitive navigation structure to support the majority of people entering from Google, not just a&nbsp;nice 
homepage. </p>

<p>Finally, we examined what we wanted to reveal to customers. We had some newer products, like&nbsp;HipChat, 
with robust, comprehensive, up-to-date documentation we could showcase. We also had great&nbsp;documentation 
for lots of other products, but not very comprehensive. We wanted to showcase the best of the best,&nbsp;and 
provide a point-of-entry for a growing product. We also had a new blog series emerging from&nbsp;developers, 
and it seemed prudent to make this easy to find. This way, we could showcase that this was a site&nbsp;that 
was <em>alive</em>: People were contributing, and the community was actively writing blogs about&nbsp;it. </p>

<p>With all three areas, we had lots of topics to surface; but no real structure yet. We turned to&nbsp;card 
sorting. Unfortunately, we weren&rsquo;t able to validate our card sorting with customers, but we did&nbsp;get 
various developers within a 1000+ person company to participate. We saw the same product-centric&nbsp;pattern: 
Organizing topics by product, and starting with tutorials and resources. We created a draft&nbsp;version, 
validated it with stakeholders, and made high-fidelity mockups. We sparred lots of versions of the&nbsp;homepage 
and information architecture with designers from around the&nbsp;company. </p>

<p>Our final design resulted in&nbsp;this:
