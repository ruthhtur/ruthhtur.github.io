    <h1>The Atlassian Verified&nbsp;dashboard</h1>

<p>I created a dashboard for add-on vendors using <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/index.html">Atlassian User Interface, or <span class="caps">AUI</span></a>. I coded high-fidelity mockups, and solicited feedback from designers and&nbsp;developers.</p>

<p>This dashboard conveys vendor status in relationship to <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/x/mIRjAQ">Verified program benchmarks</a>. Atlassian Verified vendors uphold Atlassian standards for add-on support, Marketplace traction, and product&nbsp;compatibility.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Make individual requirement statuses obvious, so vendors can use this dashboard as a checklist on the way to becoming&nbsp;Verified.</p></li>
<li><p>Wherever possible, provide options to update or modify information to minimize&nbsp;friction.</p></li>
<li><p>On hover, show contextual tooltips that explain requirements and&nbsp;tips.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Not pictured here are tooltips for each field that describe the requirements in more detail, so vendors have context and information without needing to leave the&nbsp;page.</p>

<h2>Lessons&nbsp;Learned</h2>

<p>The dashboard has been a success. I&rsquo;ve implemented changes in dashboard design, email notifications, and documentation in response to direct feedback from support and vendors. In retrospect, I should have initiated this feedback loop earlier&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>Quantitative assessments have been difficult to make since vendors are a relatively small group with specialized use cases. Metrics don&rsquo;t make a strong case for responsive design and this dashboard isn&rsquo;t optimized for mobile, but I&rsquo;d like to explore this in the&nbsp;future.</p>

<p>Things I would have done&nbsp;differently:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always make sure all stakeholders are calibrated in their goals and expectations. Overcommunication is better than undercommunication. Every stakeholder should share the same definition of&nbsp;&ldquo;success.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Conduct user research with vendors before, during, and after to gauge success&nbsp;qualitatively.</li>
<li>Work more directly with support during and after launch. Support insights can help assess if the dashboard is clear to&nbsp;use.</li>
<li>Define quantitative success metrics before design and&nbsp;implementation.</li>
</ul>
